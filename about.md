  Hey there! I am Omkar Pathak, a computer geek and a Python enthusiast currently in my last year of Computer Engineering. I love to code and I code primarily in Python language. Huge fan of open source softwares and an active contributor on GitHub. Other than programming, I love to sketch and read Agatha Christie's novels.

# Probably you may want to know more about me

*- Because everyone has a unique story..*

<p class="message scroll-effect" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
  My passion is creating full stack web applications while my interest lies in Data Science and Machine Learning. I am huge fan of Python language and love to give back to the Python community by making some useful projects.
</p>

You can see my projects [here](/projects/). I always strive to write elegant and efficient code. All my projects are open source and come with MIT license. You are free to modify the source code and free to use as you want.

In high school and also in college, I was that kid that seemed to never pay attention. I hate attending lectures. But on the same side, I love to learn and explore new technologies and create few projects using them.

Apart from programming I also love to travel. Experiencing new places and eating various cuisines is the favorite part of my life!

<!-- Take an example of this website, my [previous website](old-website.omkarpathak.in) was built upon PHP and then I came to know about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll helped me create fabulous websites with faster load speeds and great ease. For personal websites and blogs, Jekyll is a great alternative to wordpress websites. -->
