  "The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that <b>Extra</b>" and I have always found Omkar adding that extra factor in whatever work he does. He is hardworking, honest and is always in pursuit of knowledge. The first impression about Omkar that anyone will find is his technical acumen and intelligence. His real skill lies in bringing novelty in the projects he undertakes. He has a good handson experience with Python and has developed good application based on <b>Internet of Things</b>.
